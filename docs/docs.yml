  Special role to manage lxc containers lifecycle.

  The best way to use this is with this convenient shell wrapper script
  called [acm](https://github.com/archf/acm). I wanted to be able to talk to
  the lxd hypervisor directly using the `lxd_container` module.

  ## Usage

  *You can define an inventory file such as*

  ```
  [lxdhosts]
  mylxdhypervisor.example.org

  [container-group1]
  c1

  [container-group2]
  c2 lxdm_image_alias=centos7
  c3

  [lxdguests:children]
  container-group1
  container-group2

  [lxdguests:vars]
  # if you know your hydervisor is `localhost` and/or you have no sshd running
  # in the containers you can use the connection module.
  ansible_connection=lxd

  # These are the variables
  lxdm_image_alias=centos6
  ```

  See the other `lxdm` variables you can use in the role variabes section.

  *IMPORTANT*

  This role doesn't manage images. It can only manage containers. You can
  however lauch a container using `lxdm_mode=pull` and specifing
  `lxdm_server=<url of image server>`. For now, the pulled image cannot be
  assigned a local alias.
